# SM2702-Tinted Mirror

This project presents an original conceptual interactive art showing the philosophy of color. It records the source of our inspiration, research progress, and the process of creation and design.

This report first tried to introduce the philosophy of color through a philosophical question about consciousness - "What if we donâ€™t see color the same way?" In the research part, we will collect and analyze the current mainstream theories and experiments of philosophy of color. In the part of interactive art, we will analyze the history and type of interactive art and the works related to us this time.

Besides, this conceptual artwork plan is an interdisciplinary study of the philosophy of color and interactive art. It aims to cause people to think more about philosophical questions about consciousness.

Here is the detailed proposal about this application:
